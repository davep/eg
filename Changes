------------------

- eg will now suspend and resume.

- Hitting the 'n' key will re-do the last search.

Changes since 0.04
------------------

- Set SLtt_Term_Cannot_Scroll to 1. I'm told that this should improve
  the response of the screen IO. Perhaps this assumes too much?

- Bit of code tweeking. Much of the code that delt with filesystem
  characters and had lots of "#ifdef DJGPP" is now more readable
  because the filesystem specific characters are defined in eg.h.

- Minor change to egperror().

- When accepting a guide filename on the command line, eg was not
  remembering the absolute path to the file when saving the details
  to ~/.eglast. The full path to the file should now be saved.

- MakeHomeDotFile() wasn't bothering to use HomeDir() to find the
  users home directory.

- IsAnNG() wasn't correctly checking for Expert Help compiled guides.
  It now checks for 'NG' and 'EH' guides.

- Expert Help's INI file uses a 'EH' magic number, just like guides 
  that have been created with the EH compiler (why!?!). IsAnNG() now
  filters out *eh.ini as a special case.

------------------

- Tidying up to some prompts.

- Filename completion will now beep to alert you to the fact that there
  is more than one possible completion available. This works a little
  like the alert you get with the bash command line.

- eg now checks that the last remembered guide offset is still a valid
  guide entry, if it isn't, it goes to the first entry in the guide.
  This is handy when you are compiling your own guides.

Changes since 0.02
------------------

- Some guides would cause eg to die with a SIGSEGV. Would you believe
  this was all down to be malloc()ing one byte too few in ShowStdMsg()!
  I wasted an hour trying to track this one down. <sigh>

- Pressing 'd' or 'D' will bring up a menu of available Norton Guides.
  After an initial scan for guides the directory is held in ~/.egdir
  and that is the one used until you force a scan using 'D' ('d'
  will attempt to use the saved directory).

- The menu contents were being written to the screen "raw", they now
  pass thru the sane filter functions.

- eg now looks for ~/.egrc for reading config settings.

- Added "EightBit" as an option to the config file. Eight bit characters
  below this value are shown as ".", equal to or above this value they
  are shown "raw". (Not applicable to DJGPP).

- When a menu option (either normal or see also) is chosen the validity
  of the entry it points is checked. If it is invalid the user is
  informed and eg no longer bombs out with a fatal error.

- As well as remembering what guide you had loaded last the location
  within that guide is now restored as well.

- When saving files and loading files '~' is correctly expanded.

- Added filename (tab) completion to GetField().

- Updated the help screen to include the new keys.

Changes since 0.01
------------------

- The DJGPP compiled version no longer assumes that long filenames are
  always available. If LFNs are avaialble the "last guide" file is
  called $HOME/.eglast, if they are not (running under plain DOS for
  example) it is called $HOME/_eglast.

- Fixed a bug that would cause a segfault if the first search of a
  long entry failed to find anything.

- Forced the visible bell off.

- Bit of tidying up of the code that positions menus.

- Fixed eg so that it would not die if a guide contained bogus See Also
  entries.

- Fixed a bug that would get eg stuck in a long entry if you pressed
  return and there was no see also menu.

- Allowed for longer text in menu options.

- Expert Help compiled guides are now recognised as valid Norton Guides.

- Fixed a display bug in GetField() when using Ctrl-K to kill to the
  end of the line.

- Changed the way the message area works. Errors no longer require a
  keypress.

- The look of the screen has been changed to give a bit more space in
  the display area. Dunno if I like it yet.

- ShowNormal() now caches the formatted version of previously seen lines 
  in an entry. This should speed things up a little at the expense of
  memory. I might drop this yet because I'm not sure how much of a
  difference this makes.

- JumpToLine() now deals with a long entry in the same way that it
  deals with a short entry.

- Added the 'r' command to allow for the quickly loading in a new guide.

- eg now detects for displays that can't handle colour and will use a
  mono colour scheme.

- When saving source eg wasn't undoing the run length encoding of spaces.
  This is now fixed.

- Added the -s parameter to allow the user to force eg to not attempt to
  pass thru the high end IBM characters to the tty.

- Added -v parameter for displaying version information.

- Added -h parameter for displaying usage help.

- When coming back to a specific line in a short entry from another
  entry the starting point of any search was incorrectly set to the
  top of the entry no matter what line you came back to. Fixed.

- All whitespace is now trimmed off the end of each line when saving
  the content or the source of an entry to a file.

- GetField() now has a global history buffer.

- GetField() now scrolls.

Changes since 0.00
------------------

- The last attribute set on a line was used as the colour to fill the rest
  of the line. Changed this so that a line is filled out with the normal
  background colour.

- Refined the non-DJGPP version of SaneDisplay().

- Refined the DJGPP version of SaneDisplay().

- An invalid command line parameter now causes eg to quit.

- When compiled for DOS with DJGPP, the ESCape key works the same as the
  'Q' key.

- Pressing 'Q' when a menu is active now closes the menu and moves back
  to the 'Expand' menu option. Before, it would close the menu and then
  re-apply the 'Q'.

- Shortened the display area by one line and added the message line at the
  bottom of the screen.

- By default, the version of eg and path and file of the guide is shown on 
  the message line.

- Added the ability to pipe the current page to an external command.

- Added a simple search facility.

- Added a regular expression search facility.

- Added the ability to save a page to a file in either it's "raw",
  "sane" or "source" format.

- Guides with no menus are now handled correctly.

- Added the help screen.
