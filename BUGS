Lots of Unix environment issues to think about?

Can't display full IBM character set when compiled for Dos (slang 
problem?).

Screen output and refresh could possibly be improved?

No support for SIGWINCH.

The menu code is a little ropey, this needs to be re-done.

Some non-fatal errors still drop out of eg. Error reporting needs
to be improved.

Filename (tab) completion doesn't work too well under Dos when drive
letters are involved.
